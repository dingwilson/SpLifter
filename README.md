## About

SpLifter is a realtime social networking platform for local ride-sharers to connect with nearby users to split the costs of ride-sharing. This is accomplished by matching users traveling in a similar direction, and then having them walk to meet up with each other, before calling an Uber together. This project was created and featured at EagleHacks, where it won First Place Overall, and Best Domain Name Prize.
